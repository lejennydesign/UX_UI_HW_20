  <h2 class="heading2">Overview</h2>
  <p>WeBoard is a visual design mood board app that draws similarities to Pinterest and Miro. From testing 
    various mood boarding software, our team gathered various feature ideas to implement into our own app, 
    such as looking through feeds of images based on your likes, saving images to folders, then within the 
    folder or board being able to organize images, write notes, and share and collaborate on those boards 
    with others.</p>

  <h2 class="heading2">My Role</h2>
  <p>For this project, I worked as one of the project managers and lead designers. As one of the project 
    managers, I was responsible managing files for the team to access on our online drives and updating 
    the Trello Board for the team’s next tasks. I also created the UI style guide and various screens in 
    Figma for prototyping.</p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <h2 class="heading2">The Problem</h2>
  <p>We observed that designers struggle to find images shared or saved online later when they need them 
    which is causing miscommunication or delays in their workflow. How might we… improve mood boarding so 
    that our designers are successful based on the number of monthly users that create moodboards and 
    upload images?</p>
  <br>
  <h2 class="heading3">Our solution</h2>
  <p>We want to provide a flexible space to save and share photos that allows designers to organize, 
    annotate, and collaborate with ease.</p>

  <h2 class="heading3">User Research & Insights</h2>
  <p>We conducted five interviews with individuals about their creative process, and we also shared a 
    Google Form survey online to creative communities for more responses. We brainstormed various questions 
    based on what we, as designers, would do to initiate a creative project, like how we would go about it 
    at first and what tools we use to gather information.<br>
    <br>
    Based on our interview notes, users mainly like the organization aspect of certain apps (like Pinterest 
    and Miro) and the ability to collaborate with others. <br>
    <br>
    Ultimately, we learned that a creative designer needs an efficient way to save, organize and share 
    images and references because they juggle multiple projects that need to be thoroughly planned from 
    start to finish and throughout this process they will need to quickly refer back to references.</p>
  <br>
  <h2 class="heading3">User Persona</h2>
  <p>Our ideation journey started somewhere along the lines of these questions: what does the user need? 
    Which needs are most essential? How do we build empathy towards our user’s needs? We gathered our 
    interview and survey results and made a user persona named Iris Yam to reflect what kind of user we 
    expect to use our app and the needs they may have while using it. Their main goals are to be able to 
    collaborate with their partner and refer back to saved reference images later. Their pain points are 
    having trouble exporting and sharing large files and filtering through tons of saved images.

  <h2 class="heading3">Ideation Journey</h2>
  <p>After creating our user persona, we proceeded to make a story board about a user who uses our 
    WeBoard concept to organize images and ideas for her creative project. We also made task user flow 
    to represent what functions would be available in our upcoming prototype.

  <h2 class="heading3">Tasks & Goals</h2>
  <p>Each team member created their own clickable prototype to achieve the tasks and goals. Our main tasks 
    included making an easy onboarding screens, being able to make a new board in the canvas feature, the 
    ability to import images from your camera roll and providing the means to organize and share files. We 
    had to keep in mind that the onboarding process should be concise, the home page should be easy for 
    users to find their boards and make new ones, making the file import feature intuitive, and the sharing 
    options should be upfront and center.<br>
    <br>
    I drew various wireframe sketches on Procreate, a digital art software. There are is an emphasis on 
    screens of the moodboard canvas feature, as that is featured in our main user flow.<br>

  <h2 class="heading3">Testing & Key Takeaways</h2>
  <p>We conducted around 5-7 user tests on our paper prototypes for feedback. Here are some key takeaways:<br>
    <br>
    - The onboarding process was easy on all the prototypes.<br>
    - One of the prototypes had an intuitive toolbar.<br>
    - All of the prototypes need to be developed more to use its key features (the canvas space).<br>
    <br>
    Based on feedback from testing and our team votes, we iterated a low fidelity prototype with popular (and loved) features.

  <h2 class="heading3">What's Next?</h2>
  <p>One day, we would like to spend more time adding more features to this prototype, like a functioning undo 
    button on the canvas, and maybe developing a high fidelity version. Personally, I would like to spend more 
    time developing a more vibrant color system and perhaps learn how to add animations from Adobe After Effects 
    into Figma. It was engaging to work with two other designers who were just as enthusiastic to make this project 
    come true! Thanks, Katie and Lauren!</p>
